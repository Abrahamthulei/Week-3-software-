🧪 Project Overview

✅ Part 1: Theoretical Understanding

Comparison of frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, spaCy)

Use case exploration for Jupyter Notebooks

NLP advancements with spaCy


✅ Part 2: Practical Implementation

1. Scikit-learn – Decision Tree on Iris Dataset


2. TensorFlow – CNN on MNIST (98%+ accuracy)


3. spaCy – Named Entity Recognition + Sentiment on Amazon Reviews



✅ Part 3: Ethics & Optimization

Bias analysis

Debugging common TensorFlow issues


🌟 Bonus: Model Deployment

app.py hosts an interactive MNIST classifier using Streamlit
