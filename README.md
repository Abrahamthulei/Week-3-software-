ðŸ“˜ Part 1: Theoretical Understanding

Q1: Explain the primary differences between TensorFlow and PyTorch. When would you choose one over the other?

TensorFlow uses static computation graphs (though with eager execution in recent versions), which is great for production environments.

PyTorch uses dynamic computation graphs, making it easier and more intuitive for debugging and research.

Choose TensorFlow for production-level deployment and tools like TensorFlow Lite and TensorFlow Serving.

Choose PyTorch for rapid experimentation, flexibility, and academic research.

Q2: Describe two use cases for Jupyter Notebooks in AI development.

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Easily visualize and analyze datasets step-by-step.


2. Model Prototyping â€“ Build and test machine learning models in an interactive, modular format.

Q3: How does spaCy enhance NLP tasks compared to basic Python string operations?

spaCy provides advanced features like Named Entity Recognition (NER), POS tagging, and dependency parsing, which go beyond basic string matching.

It's optimized for performance and accuracy, unlike standard string methods that lack context understanding.

ðŸ§ª Part 2: Results Overview

Task 1: Decision Tree on Iris Dataset

Accuracy: ~100%

Precision: ~100%

Recall: ~100%

âœ… Simple model performed excellently due to small, clean dataset.


Task 2: CNN on MNIST

Test Accuracy: ~98%

âœ… Goal (>95%) achieved.

âœ… CNN captured spatial structure of digits effectively.


Task 3: spaCy + Sentiment (Amazon Reviews)

Named entities identified: Apple, iPhone (ORG, PRODUCT)

Sentiment: Positive

ðŸ¤– Part 3: Ethics & Optimization

Ethical Considerations

MNIST may not reflect global handwriting styles â†’ potential bias.

Amazon Reviews may include biased or fake reviews.

Mitigation:

Use TensorFlow Fairness Indicators to monitor bias metrics.

Apply rule-based filters or balanced datasets with spaCy.

Troubleshooting Challenge (Debugging Task)

Identified bug: shape mismatch in model input layer.

Fix: Used reshape(-1, 28, 28, 1) to ensure 4D input.

Adjusted incorrect loss function from categorical_crossentropy to sparse_categorical_crossentropy for integer labels.
